    "## Description\n",
    "This aircraft was built during a 10-week internship at UMD's UAS Research and Operations Center (UROC). The goal of this project was to start with a very efficient horizontal flight aircraft (a flying wing) and make minimal modifications to achieve VTOL (vertical take-off and lift) capability. \n",
